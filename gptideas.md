# Advanced Gameplay Mechanics

## Claims Processing and Risk Management
Introduce claims as a core mechanic:
- Each policy generates a chance of a **claim** being filed.
- Claims have a **severity** (low-cost, medium-cost, high-cost).
- The player can hire **Claims Adjusters** to handle claims faster or invest in **Claim Denial Algorithms** to automate rejections.

**Risk Factor:**
- Certain upgrades or events can increase or reduce the risk of claims being filed (e.g., pandemics, market regulations).

---

## Premium Adjustment
Allow the player to adjust premiums for policies:
- **Low Premiums:** Attract more clients but reduce profit per policy.
- **High Premiums:** Increase per-policy profit but lose clients or increase the Ethics Meter penalty.
- Introduce **Premium Packages** (Gold, Silver, Bronze plans) with varying benefits and claim limits.

---

## Random Crises
Build out your random events to create more chaos:
- **Regulatory Crackdowns:** If you've been denying too many claims, face penalties or legal fees.
- **Media Scandals:** Lose customers temporarily due to bad press.
- **Technological Breakthroughs:** Lower the cost of healthcare (reduces claims but makes policies less profitable).
- **Natural Disasters:** Spike in claim filings but also opportunities for surge pricing.

---

## Diversified Income Streams
Introduce new ways to make money:
- **Reinsurance:** Invest in other companies to hedge against high-cost claims.
- **Healthcare Partnerships:** Provide exclusive coverage for certain hospitals, drugs, or procedures (boost income but increase costs).
- **Preventative Care Programs:** Cost money upfront but reduce claim frequency long-term.

# More Upgrades

## Employees
- Expand beyond "employees" to specialized roles:
  - **Sales Agents:** Increase policy acquisition rate.
  - **Legal Advisors:** Reduce penalties for unethical behavior.
  - **Underwriters:** Improve client quality (reduce likelihood of high-cost claims).

## Automation
Add idle mechanics tied to automation:
- **AI-powered bots** that increase policies sold per second.
- **Claim Processing Automation:** Reduce human error and save costs.

## Buildings
Expand infrastructure to boost various stats:
- **Call Centers:** Increase policy acquisition rate.
- **Corporate HQ:** Boost global stats like revenue or client satisfaction.
- **Claims Factory:** Streamline claims processing (speed up or cheapen).

# Progression and Prestige

## Milestones
Unlock unique upgrades or bonuses for hitting policy or revenue goals.

## Prestige System
- Reset the game but carry over “Regulatory Influence Points” or “Industry Knowledge” to start with powerful buffs (e.g., +10% to all revenue).
- Name the prestige system something thematic like **Healthcare Industry Legacy** or **Insurance Empire Evolution**.

---

# Ethics and Public Opinion

## Ethics Meter
- Negative ethics events (denied claims, premium gouging) result in scandals or penalties.
- Positive ethics events (approving claims, offering free care) attract more customers but cost revenue.

## Public Opinion Bar
- Low public opinion triggers more random crises.
- High public opinion generates bonuses like government grants or faster customer acquisition.

---

# Competitors
Introduce rival insurance companies that scale alongside the player:
- Compete for customers.
- Sabotage rivals through lobbying or lawsuits.
- Steal market share through better policies or aggressive pricing.

---

# Endgame Content
- **Global Expansion:** Expand your empire to cover different countries, each with unique challenges (e.g., universal healthcare in some regions, high premiums in others).
- **Policy Monopolies:** Gain exclusive rights to insure certain sectors, like tech employees or specific age groups.
- **Dystopian Scenarios:** Automate the system so thoroughly that "coverage" becomes purely theoretical while you rake in profits.

---

# Fun Details
- Add humorous random events ("A celebrity endorsement boosts your policies by 200%!" or "Your HQ is featured in a meme, causing revenue to plummet.").
- Include quirky employee traits ("Karen from HR increases productivity but generates 30% more complaints.").
