# Coverage Cartel

## Game Concept
You start as a small-time health insurance agent with a single client, and your goal is to build an empire of policies, dodge claims, and maximize profits—all while juggling public health crises, regulatory changes, and the ethical balance of denying coverage or helping people.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### "Clicks" = Policies Sold
- Instead of cookies, your "currency" is **insurance policies**. Clicking generates new clients, each representing a policy.
- The more policies you have, the more passive income flows in through **premiums**.

### "Upgrades" = Corporate Growth
Spend your profits on upgrades to increase efficiency or exploit loopholes:
- **Automated Agents:** Hire AI bots to sell policies for you.
- **Claims Denial Department:** Increase your chances of rejecting high-cost claims.
- **Legal Loophole Experts:** Reduce penalties for denied claims.
- **Marketing Blitz:** Attract more customers through misleading ads about "affordable care."

### "Multipliers" = Industry Corruption
Unlock bonuses that let you rake in even more profits:
- **Lobbyists:** Influence regulations to favor your business.
- **Pharmaceutical Partnerships:** Drive up drug prices and take a cut.
- **Hospital Buyouts:** Force patients to use your network for inflated rates.

## Challenge Layers

### Client Needs and Claims
Every few seconds, a client files a claim. You can:
- **Approve:** Lose money but increase customer satisfaction.
- **Deny:** Boost profits but risk public backlash or lawsuits.

### Public Crises
Random events, like pandemics or natural disasters, create spikes in claims or opportunities for profit:
- **"Flu Outbreak":** Sell flu policies at a premium.
- **"Pandemic Panic":** Temporarily double premiums but face higher claim rates.

### Ethical Dilemma Meter
If you push profits too far by denying care or exploiting customers, your **"Ethics Meter"** drops. Too low, and regulators step in or your company faces public boycotts. Balancing ethics with greed becomes a strategic layer.

## Win Condition
There’s no "endgame" (classic idle game design), but milestones could include:
- Becoming the largest insurance provider in the country.
- Surviving a Congressional inquiry into your practices.
- Successfully launching a private "insurance monopoly."

## Visual and Tone
The game would lean into satire with a cartoonish art style:
- Clients with ridiculous ailments (e.g., "Overused Elbow Syndrome").
- Upgrades like a “Greedometer 5000” that directly translates customer complaints into profits.
- Over-the-top legal jargon and regulatory events poking fun at real-world healthcare complexities.
