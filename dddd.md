The phrase “deny, depose, defend, delay” refers to a strategy allegedly employed by insurance companies to avoid paying claims. Here’s a breakdown of each component:

Deny: Insurers delay or deny legitimate claims, often citing technicalities or minor issues.
Depose: Insurance companies may require claimants to undergo lengthy and costly depositions (sworn testimony) to gather information, which can be used to further delay or deny claims.
Defend: Insurers aggressively defend their actions in court, using legal tactics to prolong the claims process and increase costs for claimants.
Delay: The ultimate goal is to delay payment or resolution of the claim for as long as possible, allowing insurers to minimize their financial exposure.
This strategy is often criticized by consumer advocates and experts, who argue that it prioritizes profits over policyholders’ needs. The phrase “delay, deny, defend” has been used to describe this tactic in various contexts, including healthcare and property/casualty insurance.

Recent events have highlighted the significance of this phrase. In December 2024, a Florida woman was arrested for threatening a health insurance company using the phrase “delay, deny, depose,” echoing the tactics allegedly employed by insurance companies. Additionally, shell casings with the words “deny,” “defend,” and “depose” were found at the scene of a shooting involving a UnitedHealthcare CEO, sparking speculation about a possible motive related to insurance industry practices.
