It can't exceed the total population of the US.

# GAME MECHANICS

There needs to be more randomness, random events.

Events need to be per "phase".

Ability to fire people?

# VISUALS

Maybe when the employees become many, they need to change into many people emojis.

There should be some concept of time.


# SOUNDS

Every button must have a sound.

Every sound must increase in octaves ? or something the richer you get. Or longer snippet is played.

Sound volume must be regulated.

Variabiliy in "hi", "hello", "hey there" etc.
Maybe the first hi should be "I'm ready to sell some insurance!"

For clipboard it should be different sounds each time or lead to a sing-song-y melody?
