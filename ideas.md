It can't exceed the total population of the US.

Actually follow how Richard Burke did it.

Obviously when you click away you're still making money.

Visually represent how much money you have compared to the average American.
Here's how much money you make versus what the person you denied makes per year.

# GAME MECHANICS

Probability of claims should go up with the number of policies.

As you delay processing something should go up.

Events must be paused while modal is open. - this seems to not work when several modals are "queued up".

Clicking it should be more satisfying and/or not possible after a while?

There needs to be more randomness, random events.

Events need to be per "phase".

Ability to fire people?

Ability to do "layoffs".

Reaching certain thresholds should unlock new features.

Random events are not populated enough and don't trigger frequently enough, not enough upgrades.

Number of choices need to be randomized as well as outcome needs to be randomized.

Use separate randomization functions with different algorithms, randomize which one is likely.

Random boxes that pop up over time for increased bonuses.

Little mini games.

Dinosaur mini game - the longer you can go avoiding claims, the more money you get. If you fail within the first x seconds, you lose money.
Legislative minesweeper.


# VISUALS

Number go up is not enough of a progression.

Maybe when the employees become many, they need to change into many people emojis.

There should be some concept of time i.e. the year + month?

Understand the network of regionality.

Change the background as you get richer.


# SOUNDS

Every button must have a sound.

Every sound must increase in octaves ? or something the richer you get. Or longer snippet is played.

Sound volume must be regulated.

Variabiliy in "hi", "hello", "hey there" etc.
Maybe the first hi should be "I'm ready to sell some insurance!"

For clipboard it should be different sounds each time or lead to a sing-song-y melody?

Music for each phase.

Negative sounds and positive sounds based on choices / outcomes.

Different music as you get richer.

Each event needs its own sound. A strike should have a different sound compared to a legislative change.


# LEADERBOARD

See how fast other people have gotten to the top across the globe, your country, amongst your friends.

# Development

Cursor should only be used for the game logic. Populating events should be done by a separate agent.

Deciding "when" to trigger upgrades should be done by a separate agent.



## Chris thoughts
satisfying within the few seconds of playing, something kind of cool to hook me
visual or game mechanic
You want it to heighten.
You want to see what the next unlock is.
When do you unlock each thing? How soon do you unlock?
Money printer in idle vlogger is satisfying.
Upgrades need to be audio and visual.
Party for the executives is a buy-on - increases shareholder value but removes reputation.

A slider that shows a pile of bones to show how many people have died because of my policies.

Opportunity for a satisfying interaction.

Stamp animation to deny a claim.
Upgrade: outsource other people to deny claims for you.
Human suffering is abstracted.

Choice where every choice leads to a different modal i.e. accept Timmy's claim and you immediately lose 50.000, but he gets a new kidney. Deny and he loses his kidney, but each choice makes it harder for you to make the right decision.

Option to always look at the humanizing part, morality goes up. Reputation goes down. Resentment goes up.

Funny how evil choices get over time.
Choices are both terrible.

Upgrades make animations and sounds more intense.
