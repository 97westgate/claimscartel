## 1. Diversification into HMOs
- **Mechanic:** Transition from selling standalone policies to **offering HMO plans**.
  - Players can "invest" resources into developing an HMO model, which trades higher upfront costs (for infrastructure and staffing) for steady, long-term revenue from membership premiums.

---

## 2. Network Building
- **Mechanic:** Build a network of healthcare providers (hospitals, clinics, doctors).
  - Each provider added increases customer satisfaction and reduces claim frequency (better health management).
  - Players need to balance the cost of adding providers against the benefits.

---

## 3. Regulatory Approval
- **Mechanic:** Acquire government recognition for HMO status.
  - Requires spending money on lobbying, navigating bureaucratic delays, or increasing public approval (tie this to your Ethics/Public Opinion meter).
  - Approval unlocks new revenue streams and improves policy acquisition rates.

---

## 4. Focus on Preventative Care
- **Mechanic:** Implement **preventative care programs**.
  - Players can spend resources to reduce claim frequency and improve policy retention (clients live healthier lives, lowering risk).
  - Tie it to player upgrades or milestones, e.g., "Launch Free Health Screenings" boosts Ethics and reduces long-term costs.

---

## 5. Crisis Response
- **Mechanic:** Handle public health crises and economic changes.
  - Incorporate random events reflecting the 1970s healthcare landscape, e.g., energy crises increasing costs for providers or new diseases causing claim surges.
  - Players choose between:
    - **Profit-Driven Response:** Increase premiums or deny claims (hurts Ethics but maintains revenue).
    - **Public-Centered Response:** Absorb costs to improve Public Opinion (short-term loss for long-term gain).

# Additional Strategic Layers

## Employee Roles
Expand beyond generic "employees":
- **Policy Sales Agents:** Boost policy acquisition.
- **Underwriters:** Analyze risk to lower high-cost claim rates.
- **Claims Adjusters:** Improve claim processing speed.
- **Lobbyists:** Influence regulatory decisions to favor your company.

---

## Client Demographics
Introduce different customer profiles:
- **Young Healthy Customers:** Low premiums, low claims (good for growth).
- **Elderly Customers:** High premiums but high claim frequency.
- Players must decide which demographics to target or design tailored policies.

---

## Scale of Operations
Introduce regional markets, reflecting Charter Med’s early expansion:
- Unlock new regions (e.g., start in one state and expand nationally).
- Each region has unique challenges, e.g.:
  - Regulatory strictness (higher costs to operate).
  - Demand for services (more lucrative markets).
  - Competitors (slower acquisition rates).

---

## Competition
Simulate competition to create strategic tension:
- Rival companies poach customers or reduce your market share.
- Players can sabotage competitors through lobbying or improve their competitiveness with better provider networks.

---

# Possible Milestones for Historical Accuracy
1. **1974:** Establish Charter Med's first HMO, focusing on building provider relationships and gaining regulatory approval.
2. **1975:** Expand operations regionally and start targeting new client demographics (like large corporations for group plans).
3. **Mid-1970s:** Handle the fallout of public health challenges (e.g., mental health or chronic diseases) as HMOs grow in prominence.

---

By focusing on these mechanics, gameplay aligns more closely with Charter Med’s rise and the broader HMO movement of the 1970s. This also introduces strategic depth that mirrors the complexity of healthcare management without losing the core simplicity of a clicker game.
