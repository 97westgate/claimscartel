# UnitedHealth Group Gameplay Loop

## Core Loop (Every 1-2 seconds)
**Focus:** Making each action meaningful and providing clear feedback

1. **Policy Sales**
- Click to sell individual policies
- Each click should feel impactful with:
  - Visual feedback (policy document animation)
  - Audio feedback (satisfying "stamp" or "sign" sound)
  - Clear progress indicators
- Early policies are worth more to hook players

2. **Claims Management** 
- Claims pop up periodically based on policy count
- Each claim presents a meaningful choice:
  - Approve: Costs money but improves reputation
  - Deny: Saves money but risks reputation
  - Investigate: Takes time but may reveal fraud
- Claims should tell mini-stories about real people

3. **Resource Management**

  - Money (from premiums)
